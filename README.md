# Build a Food Review website 🌮🥑

This project's goal is to build a restaurant listing page based on the <a href="https://developers.zomato.com/">Zomato API</a> during a collaborative session. The idea is to practice further our API and JavaScript skills, but also experience, first-hand, the issues and struggles that can occur when working together with code 🍅👩‍💻
 
## Our theme: Doughnut shop restaurants in San Francisco
After fixing an initial main fetch() function, where we gather our main data on Donut Restaurants in San Francisco, as a team, we came up with ideas on what to do with that data.
We created 3 different branches for each one to work with: Styling, a sort by rating feature and a sort by price feature.
We then merged these three branches in order to end up with a fully functional site, where are features are implemented 💪🍩

## What we learned:
- Communication is key! Having regular talks with the Design team in order to prevent conflicts at the moment of merging (especially establishing class' names since the beginning).
- We learned the process of solving conflicts at the moment of merging, deciding which piece of code to keep or remove.
- Time management: this project had to be developed in under two days, so having a clear goal and defining which ideas to prioritize was very important.
